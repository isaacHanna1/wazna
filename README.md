Wazna – Youth Points & Attendance System
Wazna is a web-based application I developed to help youth leaders manage attendance, track participation,
and reward members with points based on punctuality and engagement. The system supports real-time updates, detailed reports, 
and customizable rules for calculating scores. 
It was built using Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, and Thymeleaf/JSP, with a focus on clean architecture and scalability.
